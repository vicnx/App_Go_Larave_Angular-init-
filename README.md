docker-compose version: 1.27

run ./init.sh

Modify a user to be an administrator: 

For this we have to enter the mysql container and do the following:

```
mysql -u vicnx -p
```

PASSWORD: 12345678

Next select the database:

```
USE revand
```

And now we update the user type

```
UPDATE users SET type="admin" WHERE id=1
```
